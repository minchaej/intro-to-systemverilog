## Intoduction to SystemVerilog

### What is SystemVerilog?

SystemVerilog has been called the industry's first Hardware Description and Verification Language (HDVL), because it combines the features of Hardware Description Languages such as Verilog and VHDL with features from specialised Hardware Verification Languages, together with features from C and C++. System Verilog first became an official IEEE standard (IEEE 1800™) in 2005, was updated with IEEE 1800™ 2009, and is now in the process of being further refined under the guidance of Accellera as tool vendors and users gain experience with the practical implementation and application of the language.
